# PawnShop
PawnShop is a PledgeParser for the BuyBack-List of RobertsSpaceIndustries.
This Repository is used to trace bugs and feature-development, while the code remains in a private repository.
## Getting Started
### Download the App from the Microsoft Store
https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9P58NJ8SG7Q3
### Test the App
Ask me on Reddit for Promo Codes and I will send you 3 Codes, that let you export three accounts to test the app.
### If you like the App
Buy more Add-Ons from the Microsoft Store to support me with the development
### If you have ideas or find bugs
Please check the Issues of this repo, to avoid dupes. Please let me know about them.
### If you want new features earlier
Please ask me and send me your E-Mail Address, so I can add your Microsoft Account to the Edge-Channel, that gets more updates and faster but is less stable.
## Contributing
At the moment the code remains private. To help me developing, please use the app, report bugs and ask for features.
## Versioning
